# Conservation-Nonprofits
A repository for my senior thesis code studying conservation nonprofits and how effectively they communicate their values.

This code creates a dictionary of values and values synonyms based on the Schwartz values theory and ten basic human values.
Then, values-laden language is pulled from both a nonprofit's tweets and mission/vision/values statements and similarity between the two is measured.
