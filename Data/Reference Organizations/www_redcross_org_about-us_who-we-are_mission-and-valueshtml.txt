We aspire to turn compassion into action so that...    ...all people affected by disaster across the country and around the world receive care, shelter and hope;    ...our communities are ready and prepared for disasters;    ...everyone in our country has access to safe, lifesaving blood and blood products;    ...all members of our armed services and their families find support and comfort whenever needed; and    ...in an emergency, there are always trained individuals nearby, ready to use their Red Cross skills to save lives.                    Fundamental Principles of the Global Red Cross Network      Humanity    The Red Cross, born of a desire to bring assistance without discrimination to the wounded on the battlefield, endeavors—in its international and national capacity—to prevent and alleviate human suffering wherever it may be found. Its purpose is to protect life and health and to ensure respect for the human being. It promotes mutual understanding, friendship, cooperation and lasting peace amongst all peoples.     Impartiality    It makes no discrimination as to nationality, race, religious beliefs, class or political opinions. It endeavors to relieve the suffering of individuals, being guided solely by their needs, and to give priority to the most urgent cases of distress.     Neutrality    In order to continue to enjoy the confidence of all, the Red Cross may not take sides in hostilities or engage at any time in controversies of a political, racial, religious or ideological nature.     Independence    The Red Cross is independent. The national societies, while auxiliaries in the humanitarian services of their governments and subject to the laws of their respective countries, must always maintain their autonomy so that they may be able at all times to act in accordance with Red Cross principles.     Voluntary Service    The Red Cross is a voluntary relief movement not prompted in any manner by desire for gain.     Unity    There can be only one Red Cross society in any one country. It must be open to all. It must carry on its humanitarian work throughout its territory.     Universality    The Red Cross is a worldwide institution in which all societies have equal status and share equal responsibilities and duties in helping each other.                            Global Red Cross Network  The American Red Cross is part of the world's largest volunteer network found in nearly 200 countries.

Everything we do depends on the needs of the people that we serve.
