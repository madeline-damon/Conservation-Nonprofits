About Us              OUR MISSION  The National Geographic Society uses the power of science, exploration, education and storytelling to illuminate and protect the wonder of our world.  Since 1888, the National Geographic Society has driven impact by identifying and investing in an international community of Explorers: leading scientists, educators, storytellers, conservationists, technologists, and many other changemakers who help us define some of the critical challenges of our time, drive new knowledge, advance new solutions, and inspire positive transformative change.  Since awarding our first grant in 1890, we have provided more than 14,000 grants for work across all seven continents. This includes the most comprehensive scientific expedition to Mount Everest, working to better understand human-carnivore conflict in Gorongosa, telling stories that help explain the world and all that’s in it, and groundbreaking work that has transformed our understanding of the great apes and what it means to be human.  We also engage audiences around the globe through signature experiences, stories, and content, including the National Geographic Museum at our headquarters in Washington, D.C.    See Latest News            OUR COMMITMENT TO DIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND INCLUSION    OUR PAST AND FUTURE  Our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion is more than just words. We recognize that in order to achieve our mission, we must have a diverse group of staff, Explorers, educators, and storytellers contributing their critically important perspectives and ideas. The very best ideas are a result of diverse teams and backgrounds. We are in the business of championing all voices  — it is critical to pushing us to a brighter future.  In the past, the National Geographic Society has not always valued everyone’s stories equally, and we acknowledge that we have a history of racist coverage and systemic inequality. Our work has changed over the decades, and we are committed to not only reflecting the social realities of our time, but to achieving a more equitable and inclusive world.                OUR DIVERSITY STATEMENT  In May 2020, we launched our first diversity, equity, and inclusion statement which will serve as the north star for our efforts throughout our internal and external culture, systems, and practices.  YOUR STORY MATTERS  You Bring the Yellow Border to Life   We are not all the same. It is our differences that make the National Geographic Society, and our world, a better place. We embrace each person’s identity, experiences, and abilities, and we commit to cultivating an environment where everyone benefits from opportunity, mutual respect and a sense of belonging. We all have a story to tell. When we share and celebrate our stories, the yellow border comes to life.
