We all benefit when a child succeeds in school, when someone finds a job that will help them provide for their family, or when more people are able to access quality, affordable health care.  The solutions we create for communities around the world go beyond short-term charity for a few.  When United Way’s support for Community Schools helps increase the graduation rate in the Vallejo City Unified School District by 11 percent in just three years , it’s not just the students, or even just the families of those students who benefit. Those proud graduates now have a much better chance of landing a job that pays a livable wage, of staying out of trouble with the law, and of living longer, healthier lives — and that translates into a safer, healthier and more prosperous community for everyone.  We rise or fall together. With your support, we are reaching for great new heights.          What's your mission?  Change starts with you. Take action today to make a difference in your community.
