Our free nationwide 24/7 Helpline (800.272.3900) is staffed by master’s-level clinicians and specialists, providing confidential support and information to all those affected in over 200 languages.  We conduct face-to-face support groups and education programs in communities nationwide, and work to ensure that these services reach underserved populations.  Our online community forum , ALZConnected®, provides a place for people with Alzheimer’s disease and their caregivers to connect with others, share questions, find answers and share opinions with individuals or groups in the Alzheimer’s community.  We provide innovative resources to support those living with Alzheimer’s, such as LiveWell , a suite of online tools to empower those living with the disease.  We provide caregivers and families with comprehensive online resources and information through our Alzheimer's and Dementia caregiving section, which features sections on early-stage , middle-stage and late-stage caregiving.  Our free online tool, Alzheimer's Navigator® , helps those facing the disease to determine their needs and develop an action plan.  We make it easy for families to find programs and services using the Alzheimer’s Association & AARP Community Resource Finder , a comprehensive database of dementia and aging-related resources.  We house the Alzheimer's Association virtual library , a resource center devoted to increasing knowledge about Alzheimer's disease and other dementias.

We fund scientific investigations as part of the Alzheimer’s Association International Research Grant Program .  We convene researchers at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference® (AAIC)® , the world’s largest and most influential forum for the dementia research community.  We bring researchers together worldwide to advance scientific data sharing through the Global Alzheimer’s Association International Network (GAAIN) , a first-of-its-kind online database with advanced analytical tools to accelerate discoveries.  Our scientific journal, Alzheimer’s & Dementia® , provides a single publication for the global scientific community to share its diverse knowledge.  Our professional society, Alzheimer's Association International Society to Advance Alzheimer's Research and Treatment (ISTAART) , is the only professional society designed exclusively for individuals dedicated to Alzheimer's and dementia science.

We play a key role in increasing knowledge about prevention and risk reduction. In 2018, the Association funded and implemented U.S. POINTER , a first-of-its-kind lifestyle intervention trial to reduce risk of cognitive decline and dementia. The Association is also funding SPRINT MIND 2.0, a study to clarify the role of lowering blood pressure in reducing dementia risk.   We advocate for the needs and rights of those facing Alzheimer's and all other dementia  The Association is the leading voice for Alzheimer's disease advocacy , ensuring that the need for Alzheimer's care, education and research is heard at every level of government.

We help pass landmark legislation such as the National Alzheimer's Project Act, which mandated the creation of a national plan to fight Alzheimer's and coordinates efforts toward its first goal to prevent and effectively treat the disease by 2025.  We strengthen the federal government’s commitment to Alzheimer’s research. In 2020, Alzheimer’s and dementia research funding at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) reached $2.8 billion annually. The Alzheimer’s Association, AIM and our advocates have driven bipartisan support for this rapid increase.  We develop resources, including the annual Alzheimer’s Disease Facts and Figures report, to educate decision makers and the public on the economic and emotional toll that Alzheimer's takes on families and the nation.  We secure quality health care services for those affected. The Alzheimer’s Association, AIM and our advocates championed key provisions in the Older Americans Act to ensure that individuals living with younger-onset dementia, regardless of age, have access to critical care and support services.
