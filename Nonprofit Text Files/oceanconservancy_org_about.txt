Together, we create science-based solutions for a healthy ocean and the wildlife and communities that depend on it.                  What happens to the ocean impacts all of us.  Janis Searles Jones CEO, Ocean Conservancy     See Our Work    Like all of us here at Ocean Conservancy, my love for the ocean runs deep.  The ocean has played a major role in my life since I was a kid. I still remember my first beach field trip with Mrs. Terwilliger, our community naturalist. I’ll never forget how she would show up in her pale blue VW bus to teach us about local wildlife, everything from bird calls to identifying snakes.  That first field trip will always stand out in my memory, when she taught us about the impacts of plastic on wildlife, and I felt like even though I was young, I could make a meaningful difference.  Her favorite message for children was, “ This is my country. Wherever I go, I will leave it more beautiful than I found it.”  Today, Ocean Conservancy works with millions of volunteers of all ages, from all around the world, on our International Coastal Cleanup—something we’ve been doing for more than 30 years. I participate every year, and now I’m the one teaching my daughter about the impacts of plastic on the ocean and all the amazing animals in it, and how she can make a difference.       The Ocean Is Inspiring  The ocean is at the center of who we are. Even if you’ve never seen the ocean, you’re touched by it every single day. It produces half the air you and I breathe every day, the food we eat and the water we drink.  You can’t help but be inspired by the ocean. From majestic whales to jaw-dropping waves, colorful coral reefs to graceful sea turtles, the ocean can capture your heart and soul like nothing else on earth.  This is what we’re fighting to protect. Because people and communities depend on the ocean every single day. I hope you’ll be just as inspired as I am to join us in that effort.    It’s Our Ocean  One of the things I’m most proud of at Ocean Conservancy is that we tackle the greatest global challenges facing our ocean today.  Even more, we focus on long-term solutions that promote a healthy ocean, abundant wildlife and thriving coastal communities.  What happens to the ocean impacts all of us. The ocean is our responsibility, but we can’t do it alone—we need to join forces with you and people around the world to keep our ocean and our coastal communities healthy and prosperous.      “We all have an opportunity to do something that makes the world a better place from wherever we are.”  Emily Woglom  Executive Vice President, Ocean Conservancy              #OceanOptimism  We know we can make a positive difference for the ocean—after all, we’ve been doing it for over 40 years.  I have the privilege of working with some of the best and brightest in this field, and I know that each and every one of us is dedicated to finding solutions to the challenges our ocean faces today.  Our leadership in the world of ocean conservation is built on pillars of strong science, smart policies and engaged partners. That includes ocean advocates like you that help us push for effective ocean policies, international groups that work with us to reduce plastics in the ocean and over 600,000 volunteers, including my daughter and me, who are part of the International Coastal Cleanup.        We keep it real.  Every day we strive to tell real world stories, and listen to the experiences of people who depend on a healthy ocean and collect information on our coasts and ocean.    We want to see change.  The road to change lies at the intersection of effective strategy, robust science and many, many supporters like you.    We advocate for our ocean.  We have a laser-like focus on solutions, and having a clear end goal—a healthy ocean for you, our families and our generations to come—is integral to all of our work.    We inspire people.  Here at Ocean Conservancy, we’re a collection of people who love the ocean, our coasts, and coastal communities. We’re thankful for the opportunity to share this with you.  I hope you’ll be a part of our work.          Become a voice for the ocean   Our ocean faces many threats like the onslaught of ocean trash, overfishing and ocean acidification.
