Our vision is a world where the diversity of life thrives, and people act to conserve nature for its own sake and its ability to fulfill our needs and enrich our lives.            How do we achieve this mission and vision?   Through the dedicated efforts of our diverse staff, including more than 400 scientists, all of whom impact conservation in 79 countries and territories.  With the help of our many partners, from individuals and governments to local nonprofits and corporations.  By using a non-confrontational, collaborative approach and staying true to our core values.   That’s how The Nature Conservancy has done more than anyone else to advance conservation around the world since our founding in 1951.         Our Values  As indispensable to The Nature Conservancy’s success as our unifying mission, vision, goals and measures are our unique values—the distinguishing attributes that characterize how we conduct ourselves in our drive for tangible, lasting results. These attributes are not mere platitudes but deeply held convictions universally manifested by all who represent The Nature Conservancy.           Integrity Beyond Reproach:   We will meet the highest ethical and professional standards in all of our organizational endeavors and, in doing so, we hold ourselves accountable to our mission and to the public.   Be honest at all times  Be accountable to each other, to the mission, to our donors, members, partners, and to the public ( Read our Privacy Policy )  Earn trust by building relationships, being competent, and following through on all of our commitments   Respect for People, Communities, and Cultures:  Enduring conservation success depends on the active involvement of people and partners whose lives and livelihoods are linked to the natural systems we seek to conserve. We respect the needs, values and traditions of local communities and cultures, and we forge relationships based on mutual benefit and trust.   Demonstrate respect by committing to local, on the ground involvement with people, communities and cultures, and with awareness and sensitivity to their economic realities  Treat our partners and colleagues with fairness and honesty  Work collaboratively with all sectors of society, including indigenous people, to develop practical conservation solutions.   Commitment to Diversity:  We recognize that conservation is best advanced by the leadership and contributions of people of widely diverse backgrounds, experiences and identities. We will recruit and develop staff to create a diverse, inclusive and equitable organization that reflects our global character and:   Leverage our differences to be more effective in achieving our mission  Respect and learn from our variety of experiences and ways of thinking  Create a day to day workplace climate that welcomes and encourages each of us, valuing the contributions of all  Strengthen the diversity of our workforce, trustees, and board.   One Conservancy:  Our strength and vitality lie in being one organization working together in local places and across borders to achieve our global mission. We value the collective and collaborative efforts that are so essential to our success.   Work across all of our operations to implement and support the right strategies, at the right scales, and at the right places always with the greater good of our mission in mind  Act with continuity of purpose in everything we do, from the focus of our conservation efforts to the allocation of our resources  Celebrate individual, team and project success as the success of all who work for TNC   Tangible, Lasting Results:  We use the best available science, a creative spirit, and a non-confrontational approach to craft innovative solutions to complex conservation problems at scales that matter and in ways that will endure.   Develop, analyze and use the best available conservation science and a science-based rigor to set priorities, make decisions, take action, and measure results  Use a creative spirit and original thought in the pursuit of excellence  Conduct our business in an environmentally sensitive manner               Explore     Our Mission    Our Accountability    Newsroom    Magazine    Events       CONNECT     Contact Us    Careers    FAQ    Our World Campaign       Give     Donate Now    Membership    Gift & Estate Planning         Social                                  Sign-Up for E-News     Join the million supporters who stand with us in taking action for our planet            Please provide valid email address    Join the million supporters who stand with us in taking action for our planet  Sign Up  Sign Up  Sign Up  Sign Up    Get text updates from The Nature Conservancy*          Please provide valid mobile number    Get text updates from The Nature Conservancy*            GLOBAL SITES       Australia    Brazil    Canada    China    India    Indonesia    Mexico   Hong Kong: English  中文                   The Nature Conservancy is a nonprofit, tax-exempt charitable organization (tax identification number 53-0242652) under Section 501(c)(3) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code.
