Recognizing that the problems facing our planet are increasingly more complex and urgent, we have refined the way in which we work around an ambitious new strategy.   Our new strategy puts people at the center and organizes our work around six key areas: forests, marine, freshwater, wildlife, food and climate.  By linking these six areas in an integrated approach, we can better leverage our unique assets and direct all our resources to protecting vulnerable places, species and communities worldwide.  People are at the center of our work because together we can change the trajectory of the threats to nature, and help ensure nature’s ability to provide—for the sake of every living thing, including ourselves.  We work globally, with every sector, at every level  To accomplish our ambitious goals, we work to educate and influence people into making sustainable choices and decisions, including those who work in business and make decisions around the use of natural resources, and those who work in government and set policy that impacts nature.  We work globally at every level—in the field and in the local community, from the halls of government to the global marketplace.  One of WWF’s strengths is our ability to engage stakeholders—in business, civil society, and academia—in partnerships to devise innovative solutions to the issues that challenge us.  Working together with 1.1 million supporters , WWF’s partners, projects and experts are making a difference in creating a healthy future for our planet.            Our Partnerships   Partnerships play a key role in WWF's efforts to influence the course of conservation. Lasting conservation is achieved through collaboration with a range of extraordinary partners. We leverage the strengths of these collaborations to achieve great success.    Marketing Partnerships  Humanitarian Partnerships  Corporate Partnerships        Our Projects   As the world’s leading conservation organization, WWF works in 100 countries around the globe. We seek to apply the wealth of our talents, knowledge, and passion to make the world wealthier in life, in spirit, and in living wonder of nature. Our unique way of working combines global reach with a foundation in science. It involves action at every level and ensures the delivery of solutions that meet the needs of both people and nature.        Our Experts  Science, commitment, passion and hope are all essential to protect the future of nature. No strategy will succeed without the relentless commitment of extraordinary people.
